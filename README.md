### Project Description
A decentralized platform to immortalize your dreams forever on the blockchain. Users can submit, browse, and react to bizarre subconscious experiences stored immutably for public amusement. Because no dream should go unverified.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's digital age, we share almost everything — photos, thoughts, life events — yet our most private and abstract experiences — our dreams — remain unrecorded, unowned, and unpreserved. What if dreams are a form of untapped emotional or creative intelligence? What if one day, they become valuable — for ourselves, for AI, or even as digital artefacts?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
DreamChain is a decentralized web application that enables users to record and publish their dreams securely on the blockchain. By utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage, the platform ensures that each dream entry is immutable and publicly viewable. DreamChain fosters a global, transparent dream-sharing network where users can engage with one another’s subconscious narratives, preserving them indefinitely in a distributed ledger.

NFT minted successfully.

# Diagrams
Workflow
```
1. User opens frontend (served via Vite + Vercel).
2. main.jsx mounts App.jsx to the DOM.
3. In App.jsx:
  - Wallet is connected via window.ethereum.
  - User enters a dream.
  - Dream is sent to your smart contract (on Sepolia, via ethers.js or web3.js).
  - NFT is minted and transaction data shown.
4. Smart contract is deployed to Sepolia (testnet).
5. Environment variables (like contract address, RPC URL, private key) are loaded from .env.local.
```
