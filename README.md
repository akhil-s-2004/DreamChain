### Project Description
A decentralized platform to immortalize your dreams forever on the blockchain. Users can submit, browse, and react to bizarre subconscious experiences stored immutably for public amusement. Because no dream should go unverified.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's fast-paced digital world, dreams — those strange, fleeting midnight thoughts — are often forgotten and tragically undocumented. There is no trusted, tamper-proof, decentralized system to record and publicly share one's dream experiences. Without a verifiable ledger of dreams, humanity risks losing its most unfiltered subconscious content.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
DreamChain is a decentralized web application that enables users to record and publish their dreams securely on the blockchain. By utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage, the platform ensures that each dream entry is immutable and publicly viewable. DreamChain fosters a global, transparent dream-sharing network where users can engage with one another’s subconscious narratives — preserving them indefinitely in a distributed ledger.
